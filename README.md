# R Programming Language
R is an open-source software within the GNU package, for statistical computing and graphics, it compiles and runs on a wide variety of Linux platforms, Windows,
and Mac OS. The simplest way to install the program is to follow the online instructions and use the default options. Because R is open-source software, 
it contains hundreds of packages developed by researchers around the world for various statistical analyses and data mining.

The R is a high-level programming language that is designed to be used by a human and is closer to the human language, it needs to be converted to machine 
language before being executed, so a high-level programming language can be slower. On the other hand, a lower-level programming language is a lot closer to 
the machine and computer language, it can be executed directly on a computer without the need to convert between languages before execution, 
so it can be faster than a high-level programming language and more inclined towards machine languages that deal with bits 0 and 1.
You can download and install R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) via (https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). Once there, 
under Download and Install R, choose and run the appropriate precompiled binary distributions (Download R Linux, Download R for Mac OS, or Download R for Windows). 

# What is the RStudio (IDE)?
RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. 
It adds modern features like syntax highlighting and code refactoring to R. In other words, it brings all the features that you need together in one place. 
It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop is a regular desktop application while RStudio Server runs on a remote server and allows accessing RStudio using web browser.
You can download and Install RStudio IDE via (www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
You can download and Install Git, a popular version control system on Windows via (https://git-scm.com/download/win).
